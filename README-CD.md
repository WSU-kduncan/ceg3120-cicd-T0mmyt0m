# CD with GitHub Actions & DockerHub

This document explains how to manage versioning with Git tags, semantic versioning, and how to automate container image builds and pushes using GitHub Actions.

# Part 1

## Generating Tags

### How to See Tags in a Git Repository

```
git tag
```

How to Generate a Tag in a Git Repository using semantic versioning format:

```
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
```

How to Push a Tag to GitHub

```
git push origin v0.1.0
```

# Semantic Versioning Container Images with GitHub Actions
## Summary of What the Workflow Does
### The GitHub Actions workflow:

Triggers only when a Git tag is pushed (example, v0.1.0)

Builds a Docker image using your repository's `dockerfile`

Pushes that image to DockerHub with the following tags:

- latest

- major = `0`

- major.minor = `0.1`

- major.minor.patch = `0.1.0`


## Explanation of Workflow Steps

- Checkout Code â€“ Pulls repository code into the GitHub.

- Log in to DockerHub â€“ Uses GitHub secrets to authenticate to DockerHub.

- Set Up Docker Buildx â€“ Prepares Docker to build multi-platform images.

- Generate Metadata â€“ Uses docker/metadata-action to extract version info from the Git tag and create appropriate tags.

- Build and Push Image â€“ Builds the Docker image and pushes it to DockerHub with all relevant tags.

## Explanation / Highlight of Values That Need Updated for Another Repository

### Changes in Workflow

- Update this line to match your DockerHub repository:

```
images: yourdockerhubusername/your-image-name
```

- Update build context or Dockerfile path if not using ./angular-site.

### Changes in Repository

Make sure you have a valid `dockerfile` and the `.github/workflows/main.yml` workflow.

### Add the following secrets in GitHub:
```
DOCKER_USERNAME
```
```
DOCKER_TOKEN 
```

Testing & Validating

    How to test that your workflow did its tasking
    How to verify that the image in DockerHub works when a container is run using the image
## Testing & Validating

### Ways to test if the workflow is working

- Log in to DockerHub.
- Click on your repository.
- Under `General` tab you can see `Tags` section, which list all the versions including the latest version of the image as well as time it was published.
- Alternatively you can check `Actions` tab on github.

### Verifying working image

- Pull Image
```
docker pull tummyz0/pua-ceg3120:0.1.0
```

- Run Image 
```
docker run -p 4200:4200 tummyz0/pua-ceg3120:0.1.0
```

- Visit `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to verify it is working as expected.

# Part 2

# Automated Container Deployment using DockerHub + Webhook on AWS EC2

## EC2 Instance Details

- AMI Information: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit)
- AMI ID: ami-084568db4383264d4
- Instance Type: t2.medium
- Volume Size: 30 GB
- Security Group Configuration:
  - Port 22 (SSH) - for remote access
  - Inbound & Outbound Port 9000 (Webhook Listener)
  - Inbound & Outboung Port 4200 (Angular app access)
- Justification:
  - SSH for admin access
  - 9000 for webhook payloads
  - 4200 for serving app externally

---

## âœ… Docker Setup on EC2 Instance

### Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Add current user to docker group (to avoid sudo)

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Confirm Docker is working:

```
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

Testing on EC2 Instance
Pull image from DockerHub

```
docker pull yourdockerhub/image-name:tag
```

Run container
bash
Copy
Edit
# Dev mode (interactive)
docker run -it -p 4200:4200 yourdockerhub/image-name:tag

# Prod mode (detached)
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 yourdockerhub/image-name:tag
Validate app is served:
Inside container: curl localhost:4200

From host: curl localhost:4200

From browser: http://<your-ec2-ip>:4200

Manual refresh steps:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop <container>
docker rm <container>
docker pull yourdockerhub/image-name:tag
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 yourdockerhub/image-name:tag
âœ… Scripting Container Application Refresh
Bash script: deploy.sh
This script:

Stops & removes old container

Pulls latest image

Runs a new container

Test it manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
bash /var/scripts/deploy.sh
ðŸ”— View deploy.sh

âœ… Configuring Webhook Listener on EC2
Install webhook:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install webhook -y
Verify installation:
bash
Copy
Edit
which webhook
Webhook definition file:
Contains hook ID, command path, and security via token

Validates trigger based on token in URL

Confirm definition loaded:
bash
Copy
Edit
journalctl -u webhook -f
Look for:

listening on port 9000

hook triggered successfully

Docker confirmation:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
ðŸ”— View hooks.json

âœ… Configuring Payload Sender
Selected Sender: DockerHub
Simpler setup

Automatically triggers webhook on new image push

Trigger setup:
In DockerHub â†’ Repo â†’ Webhooks

Payload URL:

php-template
Copy
Edit
http://<ec2-ip>:9000/hooks/redeploy-webhook?token=<yourtoken>
Confirm successful trigger:
journalctl -u webhook -f shows payload received

Container auto-restarts with updated image

âœ… Configure Webhook Service on EC2
webhook.service Summary:
Starts webhook on boot

Loads hooks.json automatically

Runs under ubuntu user with docker group permissions

Enable + start:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo cp webhook.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable webhook
sudo systemctl start webhook
Validate:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl status webhook
Logs:
bash
Copy
Edit
journalctl -u webhook -f
